# Ayumu

Lightweight, flexible VCS

Still in its earliest infancy, check back later.

## Codemap

Ayumu represents the revision history of a file as a (node- and edge-labeled)
DAG (poset, lattice, Boolean algebra - take your pick). Nodes labels are
parametrized, and can represent lines, but also other type with a
lines/unlines-like pair of functions.

The core of all that happens in AyDoc.hs. Diffs, currently not much more than
Data.Algorithm.Diff, show up in AyDiff.hs. Main.hs should be doing optparsing
and the like, but for these early stages while everything still happens in
memory, just has a ghci-able interactive main.

## Roadmap

+ Tests!
+ Serialization of AyDoc
+ Non-interactive option (FS)
+ DB support
+ Demos
